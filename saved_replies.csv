"3573434","Engagement GuidanceFindingATeacher","Hi {%customer.firstName,fallback= there%},<br><br>It's wonderful that you're interested in working with a teacher. There's so much to explore! There are a couple of ways to approach finding a teacher:<br><ul><li>Start by contacting one of the teachers you enjoy meditating with in the app or<br></li><li>Read through the teacher websites and see if their presentation and focus matches what you're interested in learning about. Each of these teachers is deeply versed in Buddhist philosophy so they'll all be able to help you in that area, and most of them have a focus around how mindfulness meditation shows up. For example, Sharon's well known for teaching loving-kindness meditation and how that changes our everyday experience. Alexis and Cara teach a lot about how to take mindfulness meditation off the cushion and be more mindful through the day. As you browse the websites, you'll get a sense of each teacher's approach and focus.<br></li></ul><br>Here's the contact information for most of the meditation teachers we work with.

This is {%user.firstName%} from the Support team and while we don't currently have a meditation teacher that can talk to you about how they got their training, they shared the following with me that I hope will be helpful.<br><br>Becoming a meditation teacher is often a long process. Lots of people are getting certified to teach mindfulness which is an easier process though it's still really important to understand meditation practice in a deep way. Teachers want to be able to support people when they have difficult emotions arise in meditation and that means having experienced these processes themselves. Here are a couple resources to explore:<br><ul><li><a href=""https://mmtcp.soundstrue.com/"">The Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Certification Program</a> with Jack Kornfield and Tara Brach.<br></li><li><a href=""https://www.ummhealth.org/umass-memorial-medical-center/services-treatments/center-for-mindfulness/mbsr-teacher-training"">MBSR Teacher Training - UMass Memorial Medical Center</a><br></li></ul><br>I can also offer a few suggestions on how you might find a meditation teacher to work with. One way that's common is to attend meditation retreats where you'll have opportunities to connect with the teachers leading the retreat. There might not be a retreat close to you but lots of people travel to them. If you can't attend a retreat in person, another option is to find a teacher whose recorded teachings work well for you, whether they're teachers you hear on our app or elsewhere. Lots of meditation teachers have their own websites and offer individual and group coaching opportunities so you can look them up to see what they currently offer.<br><br>I hope these suggestions are helpful — let us know if we can help with anything else.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>{%user.firstName%}<br>","","185235","1.
